# AntFarm
Small Java project about ant behavior

It's a simple WIP program, that dumps output onto the console.
What's happening currently in the simulation:
  -The program created an ant colony, with one queen and three workers.
  -The queen starts laying eggs, until she runs out of space.
  -The workers gather food, until there's a large amount of food in the colony, then start again, when supplies are low.
